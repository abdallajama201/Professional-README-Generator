## Installation

To install the app a user needs to install node.js and run “npm install” from the cloned repository.

## Usage

To use the app a user needs to run “node index.js” from the cloned repository with an optional additional argument of the relative path of the target folder you would like the README to be generated in. If the argument is left out the README will be put in the current folder. 

The user will be prompted through a series of questions where they can type in responses that will populate the various sections of the README. A video walkthrough can be found at the following link [video walkthrough](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S71VW9lnrZ5ran0Vt0ZiRus5ylvbWGUs/view).
